# Rollic Game Jam Portfolio

Hey there 👋  

We’re a new and motivated team taking our very first steps into game development.  
We don’t have any published projects yet, but we’re learning *Unity* and *Blender* and can’t wait to put our skills into practice during the Rollic Game Jam.  

Our goal is to learn, create, and most importantly, have fun building something from scratch.  
This will be our first real experience in turning ideas into a playable prototype, and we’re ready to give it our best!  

Thanks for this opportunity ❤  
– Team PMK

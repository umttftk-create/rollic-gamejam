# rollic-gamejam
Our first Game Jam project. We’re learning Unity and Blender and aiming to create our first playable prototype during the Rollic Game Jam.
# Rollic Game Jam Portfolio

We are a new team interested in learning game development.  
We don’t have any published games yet, but we’re actively learning *Unity* and *Blender*.  
Our goal for the Rollic Game Jam is to experience the full development process, from idea to prototype, and to improve our teamwork and creativity.

Thank you for the opportunity!
